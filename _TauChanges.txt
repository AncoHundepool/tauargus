sumamry    : Issue 55 (Select solver in tauArgus batch file) has been solved by adding an additional parameter in the batch file. 
             Only for CPLEX you can add the name of the licence file. It is advised to include the full path.
             E.g. <SOLVER>  CPLEX,"D:\Argus\TauData\Licencefilename"

summary    : As requested in issue 57 we have added a fourth parameter to the TauArgus commandline. 
             This parameter is the batch data directory. If no directory information is added to the name of the output file 
             in <WRITETABLE> param(4) is added to the file name.
             For the input files a file name without diretpory information is first searched in the directory of the .arb file.
             If it cannot be found there we will then try the param(4) directory.

date       : May 30, 2017
summary    : If no batch output directory has been specified, we now use the directory of the .ARB file as the output directory if no directory info is specified in the <writetable> command.
             In the previous version the current directory is often the directory of TAU_ARGUS itself, which would cause the output to be written there.

             2 will accept a non-additive table 

date       : June 3, 2017
summary    : The <VERSIONINFO> command has been added to the batch file.
			 It takes one parameter,the file to write the info.
